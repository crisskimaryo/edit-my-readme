# edit-my-readme
Edit my README is based on this [blog post](https://ryanseys.com/blog/contribute-to-readmes/). It's easy to start contributing!

This is where you put important shit about the project but since there is no project this is kinda difficult.

But what if I told you this is the project?

Then this must be where we put the important shit.
